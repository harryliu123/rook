# What is Rook?

Rook is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Rook uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Rook integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

For more details about the storage solutions currently supported by Rook, please refer to the [project status section](#project-status) below.
We plan to continue adding support for other storage systems and environments based on community demand and engagement in future releases. See our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for more details.

Rook is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as an incubating level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).

## Project Status

The status of each storage provider supported by Rook can be found in the table below.
Each API group is assigned its own individual status to reflect their varying maturity and stability.
More details about API versioning and status in Kubernetes can be found on the Kubernetes [API versioning page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning), but the key difference between the statuses are summarized below:

- **Alpha:** The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice, recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support.
- **Beta:** Support for the overall features will not be dropped, though details may change. Support for upgrading or migrating between versions will be provided, either through automation or manual steps.
- **Stable:** Features will appear in released software for many subsequent versions and support for upgrading between versions will be provided with software automation in the vast majority of scenarios.
